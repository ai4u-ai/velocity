Use Velocity to manage the full life cycle of deep learning. Annotate and manage data sets, Convert Data Sets, continuously train and optimise custom algorithms. 
Velocity comes with over [40 computer vision deep learning algorithms for classification and object detection](implemented_algorithms.md)  . You are able to go from idea to trained algorithm within in days. No coding needed just
choose one of out of the box configured algorithms and start training.

### [First Login](FIRTSRUN.md) 
Velocity is running on port 3000. When you access the first time http://your_ip_or_domain:3000  you will be redirected to the login page. 
[Create an account or login as demo user.](FIRTSRUN.md) 
You can have limitless users on velocity. All of the artifacts of a user are not shared with other users. 
### [Upload Media](MEDIA.md) 
 
You can [upload media](MEDIA.md)  using the web interface or indicate a path where your media files are on the server. 
You can than mount a bucket to that path.

### [Create Annotations](annotations.md) 
To train an algorithm you need [annotated data](annotations.md). Every image needs to have a label associated to it. So that the algorithm learns to mapping between the image and the label. Labeling images is a labour intensive task.
Out tool permits you to [create annotations while the video is running](annotations.md). 



### [Create Data Sets](datasets.md)
You can use multiple annotation collections to create a data set. We have created a tool that permits you to do that by [dragging and dropping annotation collections](datasets.md). In the same tool you can 
combine multiple data sets into one again just by dragging and dropping.
