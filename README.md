Use Velocity to manage the full life cycle of deep learning. Annotate and manage data sets, Convert Data Sets, continuously train and optimise custom algorithms. 
Velocity comes with over [40 computer vision deep learning algorithms for classification and object detection](implemented_algorithms.md)  . You are able to go from idea to trained algorithm within in days. No coding needed just
choose one of out of the box configured algorithms and start training.

### [First Login](FIRTSRUN.md) 
 
Login and create an account

### [Upload Media](MEDIA.md) 
 
You can [upload media](MEDIA.md)  using the web interface or indicate a path where your media files are on the server. 
You can than mount a bucket to that path.

### [Create Annotations](annotations.md) 
To train an algorithm you need annotated data. Every image needs to have a label associated to it. So that the algorithm learns to mapping between the image and the label. Labeling images is a labour intensive task.
Out tool permits you to create annotations while the video is running. 



### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ai4u-ai/velocity/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
