## Create Data Sets:

Use the tool to create data sets by dragging and dropping annotations and or other data sets. A data set name is generated but you can change it if you wish.

## Transform data sets:
Different algorithms need a different type of data format and annotation. For instance a classification algorithm take the full image as an input and provides the probability of a class as a prediction.
An object detection algorithm will predict not only the class but the bounding box of this class. Our tool permits you to transform your annotations to both use cases.
You are able as well to just download the transformed data set and use it. The tool will inform you during the creation of the data set how many labels there are and how many annotations per label.
This is important as you don't want you data to be unbalanced. Make sure that you have similar amount of annotations per class.

## Annotate:

Click on play on one of the time lines. Draw a box with your mouse on the screen. Follow the object you are annotating by dragging the square with your mouse.
The annotations will appear in the Annotations window. You can scroll down in the annotations window. You can delete an annotation that does not appear to be good.
Occasionally save and delete the annotations.

## Manage Annotations:

You can manage all the annotations in the annotations module. Select an annotations collection to see all the annotations. When clicking on one of the annotations the video player will show the exect time frames
and a red square will appear on the exact place the annotation is made. You can delete an annotation by clicking on the delete button in the annotation.
